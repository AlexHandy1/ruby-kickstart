# DO NOT STRUGGLE ON THIS PROBLEM FOR MORE THAN 30 MINUTES!!

# Define a class called User that keeps track of a person's username
# it should receive the username when initialized
# it should have a method add_blog which accepts a date and text
# it should have a method blogs which returns an array of all blogs the user has written
# they should be in reverse chronological order (newest first)
#
# Define a class called Blog that could be used to store an entry for your web log.
# The class should have a getter and setter methods: text , date , user
# its initialize method should receive the date, user , and text
# have a method called summary that returns the first 10 words from the text (or the entire text if it is less than 10 words)
#
# Two blogs should be equal to eachother if they have the same user, date, and text
# here is a partially filled out example of how to define the == operator:
#      def ==(other)
#        return self.date == other.date
#      end

#steps
	#set-up class User - ultimately stores user info and their blogs
	#initialize the user when receives a username
	#method add_blog that takes a date and text to add to a blog
	#method blogs that returns array of all blogs user written in chronological order (newest first)
		# => pulls in an array (where stored?) and sorts (method to make sure most recently added is first 
			#- this may be through how you add blogs e.g. goes at the front with unshift) 
		# => need to think about the .entry variable?
	
	#set-up class Blog - ultimately stores entry for web log
	#set up initialize with accessible (getter and setter) methods for text date and user
	#method for summary first 10 words from text or entire text if less than 10 words
		# => method on a string or array which take first x number of words - something like head-10 in command line
			#may also need the else statement for showing whole string
	#set-up a comparison method to check if two blogs same - if have same user, date and text?
